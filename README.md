# RoboHero
A game code with a clear task developed in Python

The task is to reach the door to save the princess without touching the monsters and with the highest score possible.
There is a counter on the right top; which gives score feedback to the user while collecting the valuable items.
The final score is not connected with another condition like the final emotional /  satisfactional condition of the princess, but it can.
RoboHero shouldn't get in touch with the monsters, otherwise, the game is over.
What/who is to be rescued in the game is edittable.
The source code is divided into functions for the sake of happiness for all.

to be able to activate the code use the following character visuals in .png format:
-door
-coin
-monster
-robot
